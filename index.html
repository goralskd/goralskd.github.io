    <div class="about">
        <img src="images/Lebron.png">
        <p>My name is Dillon Goralski. I'm a student at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about becoming 
          stronger, healthier, and overrall a better person. I am also extremely passionate about DJing and always want to keep improving. 
          I intend to change my 
          lifestyle to achieve these things. I'm still figuring out what specific career path I want to pursue, 
          but I've considered Cyber Security. However I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me, 
          and I'm open to exploring other fields that align with my skills and interests.
